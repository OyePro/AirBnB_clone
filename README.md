# Description 
AirBnB Clone Project; The goal of the project is to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website on my server. It's one of the project done while learning Software Engineering at Alx School. This repository consists of one of the four projects that will be done to clone the AirBnB website. In this phase, a basic console was created using the Python module, Cmd, to manage the objects of the whole project through implementation of the methods `create`, `show`, `update`, `all`, and `destroy` to the existing classes and subclasses.
